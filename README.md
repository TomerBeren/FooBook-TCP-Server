# TCP Server Integration Branch

This branch is dedicated to the integration of the TCP server with the Bloom filter functionality established in Part 1 of our project. The TCP server in this branch is configured to work seamlessly with our Node.js server and web client, providing enhanced URL filtering capabilities.

## Overview

The TCP server utilizes a Bloom filter to efficiently check URLs for potential security threats. This integration is aimed at enhancing the security measures of our web application by preventing access to malicious URLs.

## Key Features

- **Bloom Filter Integration**: Incorporates the Bloom filter from Part 1 to check URLs.
- **TCP Server**: Facilitates communication between the Node.js server and the web client, ensuring that URL checks are performed swiftly and accurately.
- **Security Enhancement**: Improves the overall security of the web platform by filtering out potentially harmful URLs before they reach the user.
